<b><font size="+2">Just your friendly, neighborhood Sysadmin-Man</font></b>

Two decades or so of system and networking experience in large environments. I've seen some stuf, man... and luckily I've been able to repress some of those memories. Whenever possible, I try to document my pain so that others might learn from it, and perhaps save themselves some grief.

This IPv6 project documented here was just for fun (??) and my own edification. Getting functional IPv6 in my home/lab environment was an added bonus, I guess.

Professionally, my current area of focus is supporting the Comcast CDN team and their [Apache Traffic Control](http://trafficcontrol.apache.org/) network, working to improve config management, troubleshooting content delivery issues, DevOps'ing all the things, and generally doing my best to make sure the bits are flowing.
